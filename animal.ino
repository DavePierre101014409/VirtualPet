  Circuit 4C - Heads Up Game

  This is a DIY version of the popular Heads Up party game. To play, one person resets the RedBoard and holds the LCD
  facing away from them so that they cannot see it (usually on their forehead). The display will show a short countdown
  then display random words. The other player(s) who can see the screen must yell out clues until time runs out or the player
  guesses what word is on the screen. If they guess correctly, they can press the button on the breadboard and another word
  will be displayed.

  This sketch was written by SparkFun Electronics, with lots of help from the Arduino community.
  This code is completely free for any use.
